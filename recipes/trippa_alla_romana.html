    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tripe was once a common part of the Italian diet, and no where more so than Rome. The inhabitants of the Eternal City are famous for their love of offal, which they jocularly call the <em>quinto quarto</em>, or the ‘fifth fourth’, a butcher’s term for those humble parts of the animal that the nobility and clergy left for the common folk. Saturday was the traditional day in Rome and elsewhere in Italy to eat tripe—<em>sabato trippa</em>, the expression went—but the custom is, like so many old customs, fading fast. Indeed, organ meats in general are falling ever more out of favor, as elsewhere in the world.</p>
    <p>It’s a sad story, if you ask me, but there’s a silver lining for those of us who still love the <em>quinto quarto</em>: unlike other humble cuts that have become fashionable like short ribs or oxtail, under-appreciated tripe is still very economical. And <strong><em>trippa alla romana</em></strong>, or Roman-Style tripe, is one of the most flavorful ways of enjoying trip that I know of. Here’s a somewhat updated version of that Roman classic.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kilo (2 lbs) tripe, pre-cooked and cut into strips</li>
        <li>100g (3-1/2 oz) pancetta, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 dried red hot pepper (peperoncino) or a pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>250-300g (1/2-2/3 lb) canned tomatoes, sieved, or passata di pomodoro</li>
        <li>Olive oil (or lard)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the pancetta in olive oil (or lard) in a large pot, together with the <em>peperoncino</em> if using.</li>
        <li>Add onion, carrot and celery, and continue sautéing, seasoning with salt and pepper, until the vegetables are nice and soft.</li>
        <li>Add your pre-cooked, cut into bite-sized strips tripe (along with a pinch of red pepper flakes if using those). <li>
        <li>Mix it all well, and allow to simmer so that the tripe begins to insaporire, or absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add a splash of white wine, and when it has evaporated, add crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer, stirring from time to time,for about 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>About 5 minutes before you are ready to serve the tripe, add a handful of mint.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, topped with a generous grating of pecorino cheese..</li>
    </ol>
